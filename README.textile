A set of helpers for creating a flat-file representation of your Django site.

h2. Features

* Models, views and management commands to will build your site as flat files.
* Management commands to sync your flat files with a bucket on Amazon S3.

h2. Getting started

Simply install bakery, create models using the BuildableModel class, and write your views using the BuildableDetailView class. Edit your settings.py, and add those views to your BAKERY_VIEWS setting as a list of strings, eg ['example.views.AlbumDetailView',].

Now on the command line, run python manage.py build. Your views should bake into a build folder as flat pages. Optionally, you can publish these files to S3 for cheap hosting.

For an example app written using bakery, check out the example branch: https://github.com/datadesk/django-bakery/tree/example
