Models, views and management commands to help you create flat pages from your Django app.

Simply install bakery, create models using the BuildableModel class, and write your views using the BuildableDetailView class. Edit your settings.py, and add those views to your BAKERY_VIEWS setting as a list of strings, eg ['example.views.AlbumDetailView',].

Now on the command line, run python manage.py build. Your views should bake into a build folder as flat pages. Optionally, you can publish these files to S3 for cheap hosting.

For an example app written using bakery, check out the example branch: https://github.com/datadesk/django-bakery/tree/example
